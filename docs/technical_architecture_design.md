## Architecture Overview

The WPForms replacement plugin follows a modern, modular architecture designed to provide maximum flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility while adhering to WordPress development best practices. The architecture is built on several key principles that ensure the plugin can scale with the website's growing needs while maintaining optimal performance and security.

The core architecture employs a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern adapted for WordPress plugin development, where Models handle data persistence and business logic, Views manage the presentation layer for both admin and frontend interfaces, and Controllers orchestrate the interaction between Models and Views while handling user requests and system events. This separation of concerns ensures that each component has a single responsibility, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.

The plugin architecture is designed with a service-oriented approach, where major functionalities are encapsulated in dedicated services that can be independently developed, tested, and maintained. These services include the Form Builder Service for managing form creation and editing, the Entry Management Service for handling form submissions and data processing, the Notification Service for managing email and other communication channels, the Security Service for implementing anti-spam and validation measures, and the Integration Service for connecting with third-party platforms and APIs.

The data layer utilizes WordPress's native database abstraction layer while extending it with custom table structures optimized for form data storage and retrieval. This approach ensures compatibility with WordPress hosting environments while providing the performance characteristics needed for handling large volumes of form submissions and complex form structures.

The presentation layer is built using modern web technologies, with React.js powering the administrative interface to provide a responsive and intuitive user experience for form creation and management. The frontend form rendering utilizes vanilla JavaScript with progressive enhancement principles, ensuring forms work across all browsers and devices while maintaining optimal performance and accessibility standards.

## Database Design

The database architecture for the WPForms replacement plugin is designed to efficiently store and retrieve form definitions, submissions, and related metadata while maintaining data integrity and supporting complex querying requirements. The design follows WordPress database conventions while introducing specialized tables optimized for form-specific operations.

### Core Database Tables

The plugin introduces four primary database tables that work together to provide comprehensive form management capabilities. The `wp_custom_forms` table serves as the central repository for form definitions, storing essential metadata including form titles, descriptions, status indicators, creation timestamps, and serialized form structure data. This table includes fields for `form_id` as the primary key, `form_title` for human-readable identification, `form_description` for administrative notes, `form_status` to control form availability, `form_structure` containing the JSON-encoded form field definitions, `created_date` and `modified_date` for audit trails, and `form_settings` for storing form-specific configuration options.

The `wp_custom_form_entries` table manages individual form submissions, with each record representing a complete form submission event. Key fields include `entry_id` as the primary key, `form_id` as a foreign key linking to the forms table, `entry_data` storing the JSON-encoded submission data, `submission_date` for temporal tracking, `user_ip` for security and analytics purposes, `user_agent` for browser identification, `entry_status` for workflow management, and `spam_score` for anti-spam filtering. This table is optimized for high-volume insertions while supporting efficient querying for administrative interfaces.

The `wp_custom_form_fields` table provides detailed field definitions and metadata, enabling complex form structures and validation rules. Each record represents a single form field with attributes including `field_id` as the primary key, `form_id` linking to the parent form, `field_type` specifying the input type, `field_label` for user-facing text, `field_name` for programmatic identification, `field_options` containing JSON-encoded field-specific settings, `validation_rules` for input validation, `conditional_logic` for dynamic field behavior, and `field_order` for display sequencing.

The `wp_custom_form_notifications` table manages email notification configurations, supporting multiple notification scenarios per form. Fields include `notification_id` as the primary key, `form_id` linking to the associated form, `notification_type` distinguishing between admin and user notifications, `recipient_email` for delivery addresses, `email_subject` and `email_body` for message content, `notification_conditions` for conditional sending, and `notification_status` for enabling or disabling specific notifications.

### Database Relationships and Constraints

The database design implements proper relational constraints to maintain data integrity and support efficient querying. The primary relationship exists between forms and entries, where each entry belongs to exactly one form, but each form can have unlimited entries. This one-to-many relationship is enforced through foreign key constraints that prevent orphaned entries and ensure referential integrity.

Form fields maintain a similar one-to-many relationship with forms, where each field belongs to a single form but forms can contain multiple fields. The field ordering system uses integer values to maintain display sequence, with automatic reordering capabilities when fields are added, removed, or repositioned within the form builder interface.

Notification configurations are linked to forms through foreign key relationships, allowing multiple notification rules per form while ensuring that notification settings are automatically cleaned up when forms are deleted. The database design includes cascading delete rules that maintain consistency when forms are removed from the system.

### Indexing Strategy

The database design includes a comprehensive indexing strategy optimized for the most common query patterns expected in form management operations. Primary indexes are created on all primary key fields, while secondary indexes are strategically placed on frequently queried columns such as `form_status` in the forms table, `submission_date` and `form_id` in the entries table, and `form_id` and `field_order` in the fields table.

Composite indexes are implemented for complex queries, particularly for the entries table where combinations of `form_id` and `submission_date` are frequently used for administrative reporting and data export operations. The indexing strategy is designed to support efficient pagination of large entry datasets while maintaining optimal performance for form rendering and validation operations.

### Data Migration and Versioning

The database architecture includes built-in support for schema versioning and data migration, essential for plugin updates and WPForms data import operations. A dedicated `wp_custom_forms_meta` table stores schema version information and migration status, enabling automated database updates during plugin upgrades.

The migration system is designed to handle the conversion of existing WPForms data structures to the new plugin format, with specialized migration scripts that preserve all form definitions, historical submissions, and configuration settings. The migration process includes validation steps to ensure data integrity and rollback capabilities in case of migration failures.


## Plugin Structure and Organization

The plugin follows a modular, object-oriented architecture that promotes code reusability, maintainability, and testability. The directory structure is organized according to WordPress plugin development best practices while incorporating modern PHP development patterns including namespacing, autoloading, and dependency injection.

### Directory Structure and File Organization

The root plugin directory contains the main plugin file `custom-forms-plugin.php` which serves as the entry point and handles plugin activation, deactivation, and initialization. The plugin follows the WordPress plugin header standards and includes all necessary metadata for proper plugin recognition and management within the WordPress ecosystem.

The `src` directory contains the core plugin source code organized into logical modules. The `Controllers` subdirectory houses all controller classes responsible for handling HTTP requests, processing form submissions, and managing administrative actions. Key controllers include `FormController` for form CRUD operations, `EntryController` for submission management, `AdminController` for administrative interface handling, and `PublicController` for frontend form rendering and processing.

The `Models` directory contains all data model classes that encapsulate business logic and database interactions. The `Form` model handles form definition operations, the `Entry` model manages submission data, the `Field` model represents individual form fields with their validation and rendering logic, and the `Notification` model manages email notification configurations and delivery.

Service classes are organized in the `Services` directory, providing specialized functionality that can be shared across multiple controllers and models. The `FormBuilderService` handles the complex logic of form creation and editing, the `ValidationService` manages field validation and data sanitization, the `NotificationService` orchestrates email delivery and template processing, the `SecurityService` implements anti-spam measures and access control, and the `ExportService` handles data export operations including CSV generation.

### Class Architecture and Design Patterns

The plugin architecture employs several design patterns to ensure code quality and maintainability. The Singleton pattern is used for core service classes that should have only one instance throughout the plugin lifecycle, such as the main plugin class and configuration managers. The Factory pattern is implemented for creating form field objects, allowing for dynamic field type instantiation based on configuration data.

The Observer pattern is utilized for event handling, enabling loose coupling between different plugin components. Form submission events, validation events, and notification events are all handled through this pattern, allowing for easy extension and customization without modifying core plugin code.

Dependency injection is implemented through a custom container class that manages object instantiation and dependency resolution. This approach facilitates unit testing by allowing mock objects to be injected during test execution, while also promoting loose coupling between classes.

The plugin implements a comprehensive hook system that extends WordPress's native action and filter hooks. Custom hooks are defined for major plugin events such as form creation, entry submission, validation completion, and notification sending. This hook system allows theme developers and other plugins to extend functionality without modifying core plugin files.

### Autoloading and Namespace Management

The plugin implements PSR-4 compliant autoloading through Composer, enabling automatic class loading without manual require statements. The root namespace `CustomFormsPlugin` contains all plugin classes, with sub-namespaces for different functional areas such as `CustomFormsPlugin\Controllers`, `CustomFormsPlugin\Models`, and `CustomFormsPlugin\Services`.

Namespace organization follows the directory structure, making it intuitive for developers to locate and understand class relationships. The autoloader configuration is defined in the `composer.json` file, and the generated autoloader is included in the main plugin file to ensure all classes are available when needed.

## API Design

The plugin implements a comprehensive REST API that follows WordPress REST API conventions while providing specialized endpoints for form management operations. The API is designed to support both internal plugin operations and external integrations, with proper authentication, authorization, and rate limiting mechanisms.

### REST API Endpoints

The API is organized into logical resource groups, each with standard CRUD operations and specialized endpoints for specific functionality. The `/wp-json/custom-forms/v1/forms` endpoint group handles form management operations, including `GET /forms` for retrieving form lists with pagination and filtering support, `POST /forms` for creating new forms with validation, `GET /forms/{id}` for retrieving specific form definitions, `PUT /forms/{id}` for updating existing forms, and `DELETE /forms/{id}` for form deletion with proper cleanup.

Entry management is handled through the `/wp-json/custom-forms/v1/entries` endpoint group, providing `GET /entries` for retrieving submission data with advanced filtering and sorting options, `POST /entries` for programmatic form submissions, `GET /entries/{id}` for individual entry retrieval, `PUT /entries/{id}` for entry updates and status changes, and `DELETE /entries/{id}` for entry removal with audit logging.

Specialized endpoints support advanced functionality such as `/wp-json/custom-forms/v1/forms/{id}/export` for data export operations, `/wp-json/custom-forms/v1/forms/{id}/duplicate` for form cloning, and `/wp-json/custom-forms/v1/entries/bulk-actions` for batch operations on multiple entries.

### Authentication and Authorization

The API implements WordPress's native authentication mechanisms while adding specialized authorization rules for form-specific operations. User authentication is handled through WordPress nonces for logged-in users and API keys for programmatic access. The plugin supports multiple authentication methods including cookie-based authentication for admin interface operations, API key authentication for external integrations, and JWT token authentication for mobile applications.

Authorization is implemented through a capability-based system that extends WordPress's role and capability framework. Custom capabilities such as `manage_custom_forms`, `view_form_entries`, `export_form_data`, and `configure_form_notifications` are defined and can be assigned to user roles through standard WordPress mechanisms.

The API includes rate limiting functionality to prevent abuse and ensure system stability. Rate limits are configurable per endpoint and user role, with different limits for authenticated and unauthenticated requests. The rate limiting system uses WordPress transients for storage and includes proper HTTP headers to inform clients of their current usage status.

### Data Validation and Serialization

All API endpoints implement comprehensive input validation using a centralized validation service that ensures data integrity and security. Input validation includes data type checking, format validation, range validation, and custom business rule validation. Validation errors are returned in a standardized format that includes field-specific error messages and suggested corrections.

Data serialization follows JSON API specifications with consistent response formats across all endpoints. Response objects include proper HTTP status codes, standardized error formats, pagination metadata for list endpoints, and HATEOAS links for related resources. The serialization system supports field filtering and sparse fieldsets to optimize response sizes for different client requirements.

The API includes comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages for development environments and sanitized messages for production use. Error responses include unique error codes that can be used for programmatic error handling and user interface localization.

### Webhook System

The plugin implements a flexible webhook system that allows external services to receive real-time notifications of form events. Webhook configurations are managed through the administrative interface and can be triggered by various events such as form submissions, entry status changes, and form modifications.

Webhook delivery includes retry logic with exponential backoff for failed deliveries, signature verification for security, and comprehensive logging for troubleshooting. The webhook system supports custom payload formats and can include filtered data based on form configuration and recipient requirements.

## Security Architecture

Security is a fundamental aspect of the plugin architecture, with multiple layers of protection implemented to safeguard against common web application vulnerabilities and form-specific attack vectors. The security architecture follows defense-in-depth principles, implementing security measures at every layer of the application stack.

### Input Validation and Sanitization

All user input undergoes rigorous validation and sanitization before processing or storage. The validation system implements a multi-stage approach that includes client-side validation for user experience, server-side validation for security, and database-level constraints for data integrity. Input validation rules are defined declaratively for each form field type and can be customized through the form builder interface.

The sanitization process removes potentially malicious content while preserving legitimate user data. Different sanitization strategies are applied based on data type and intended use, with HTML content being filtered through WordPress's KSES system, URLs being validated against allowed protocols, and file uploads being scanned for malicious content.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention is implemented through systematic output escaping using WordPress's escaping functions. All dynamic content is properly escaped based on context, with different escaping strategies for HTML content, JavaScript variables, CSS values, and database queries. The plugin includes automated testing to verify that all output paths are properly protected against XSS attacks.

### Anti-Spam and Bot Protection

The plugin implements a comprehensive anti-spam system that combines multiple detection techniques to identify and block automated submissions. The system includes traditional CAPTCHA integration with support for Google reCAPTCHA v2 and v3, hCaptcha, and custom challenge-response mechanisms.

Honeypot fields are automatically added to forms as invisible traps for automated bots. These fields are hidden from legitimate users through CSS but are detectable by screen readers and other assistive technologies to maintain accessibility. Submissions that include data in honeypot fields are automatically flagged as spam and can be blocked or quarantined based on configuration.

Time-based analysis tracks the duration between form load and submission to identify suspiciously fast submissions that indicate automated behavior. The system maintains statistical models of normal user behavior and flags submissions that deviate significantly from expected patterns.

IP-based rate limiting prevents excessive submissions from individual addresses while allowing legitimate users to resubmit forms when necessary. The rate limiting system includes whitelist functionality for trusted IP ranges and can be configured with different limits for different form types.

### Data Encryption and Privacy

Sensitive form data is encrypted at rest using WordPress's built-in encryption capabilities supplemented with additional encryption for highly sensitive fields. The encryption system uses industry-standard AES-256 encryption with keys managed through WordPress's authentication system.

Personal data handling follows GDPR requirements with built-in tools for data anonymization, deletion, and export. The plugin includes automated data retention policies that can delete old submissions based on configurable time periods, with special handling for forms that require longer retention periods for legal or business reasons.

Database security includes protection against SQL injection attacks through the exclusive use of prepared statements and parameterized queries. All database interactions are routed through WordPress's database abstraction layer, which provides built-in protection against common database vulnerabilities.

### Access Control and Permissions

The plugin implements a granular permission system that controls access to different functionality based on user roles and capabilities. Administrative functions are protected by capability checks that verify user permissions before allowing access to sensitive operations.

Form-level access control allows individual forms to be restricted to specific user roles or individual users. This functionality supports use cases such as member-only forms, staff-only feedback forms, and role-specific registration forms.

Session management includes protection against session fixation and session hijacking attacks through proper session token handling and regeneration. The plugin integrates with WordPress's native session management while adding additional security measures for form-specific operations.

File upload security includes comprehensive validation of uploaded files, including file type verification, size limits, and malware scanning integration. Uploaded files are stored in protected directories with randomized filenames to prevent direct access and potential security vulnerabilities.


## User Interface Architecture

The user interface architecture is designed to provide an intuitive and efficient experience for both administrators managing forms and end-users completing form submissions. The architecture separates concerns between administrative interfaces and public-facing forms while maintaining consistent design patterns and user experience principles throughout the plugin.

### Administrative Interface Design

The administrative interface is built using React.js with a component-based architecture that promotes reusability and maintainability. The interface follows WordPress admin design guidelines while incorporating modern user experience patterns that enhance productivity and reduce cognitive load for form administrators.

The main administrative dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of all forms with key metrics such as submission counts, completion rates, and recent activity. The dashboard utilizes a card-based layout that allows administrators to quickly assess form performance and identify forms requiring attention. Interactive charts and graphs provide visual representations of form analytics, with drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.

The form builder interface implements a drag-and-drop paradigm that allows administrators to construct complex forms without technical knowledge. The builder includes a field palette with all available field types, a canvas area for form construction, and a properties panel for configuring field-specific settings. Real-time preview functionality shows exactly how forms will appear to end-users, with responsive preview modes for different device types.

Field configuration interfaces are context-aware, showing only relevant options for each field type while providing advanced configuration options for power users.
